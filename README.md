# FGSM
Implements Fast Gradient Sign Method proposed by Goodfellow et al.


The python notebook contains code for training a simple feed forward Neural Network in PyTorch.
The network is then fooled by adversarial examples generated by FGSM algorithm proposed in:
"Goodfellow, Ian J., Jonathon Shlens, and Christian Szegedy. "Explaining and harnessing adversarial examples (2014)." arXiv preprint arXiv:1412.6572."


# Church Window Plots 
Also implements Church Window Plots to visualize decision boundaries as proposed in
Warde-Farley, David, and Ian Goodfellow. "11 adversarial perturbations of deep neural networks." Perturbations, Optimization, and Statistics (2016): 311.
